# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Using Pyspark to perform ETL and connect to an AWS RDS instance


## Overview

In this project, we’ll have access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. We’ll need to pick one of these datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, we’ll use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, we’ll write a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.
